# Concurrency-using-Scala

<p>Scala is a contemporary multi-paradigm computer language that is intended to describe common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe manner. It is a high-level language that blends object-oriented and functional programming. Scala's static types aid in the avoidance of bugs in complicated applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes enable the development of high-performance systems with simple access to vast ecosystems of libraries.

# Code Description

<p>This is a project in which I demonstrated concurrency using Scala in four distinct ways:

<ul>
    <li>CyclicBarrier and countDownLatch</li>
    <li>Exchanger</li>
    <li>BlockingQueue and blocking Dequeue</li>
    <li>Concurrent HashMap using semaphore</li>
</ul>

<p>The code uses the above four methods over simple functions like sum_factorial(), fact(), armstrong() and doRandomWork() to demonstrate concurrency in Scala.
